Hi! I am Yuxin Liu🙋, a senior **Computer Science and Technology**👩‍💻 undergraduate student at [Northeast Agricultural University](http://www.neau.edu.cn/)🎓. It's my honor to be ranked 1 among 212 students🥇, and win the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Chinese National Scholarship 🏆! 

I have a positive willingness to work with active industry and academic frontiers and practitioners in computational-related technology. 
My initial research work was as a Research Assistant for Stanford Postdoctoral Researcher [*Hongwei Wang*](https://hongweiw.net/) to study the Deep Recommender Systems. I eminently participated in the workshop on Neural Networks and Machine Learning algorithms was instructed by [*Dr.Qing Zhu*](https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/qing-zhu/). My paper on Domain Adaptation independent research directed by [*PhD. Xudong Lin*](https://xudonglinthu.github.io/) is about to be completed!

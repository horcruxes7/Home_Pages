My previous research lies on Semantic Segmantation[`[R1]`](#about), One-shot Learning, Domain Adaptation, Medical Imaging and Deep Recommender System. My main focus has been created original and novel **Weakly Supervised** or **Unsupervised Learning** frameworks,  **Neural Network architecture** and **algorithm** for **natural or medical** image **segmentation and classification** to solve problems due to scarcity of **annotations** and expert experience and time, and also improve the performance. <br>
 *<font size=2 >The following blow can be read together with my [CV]()</font> <br>
I harbor pure passion and pursuit of **enlightened research** and exploration of **unknown realms** of science and its 'landing application'. The entry for my initial research was not only the `theory` of deep learning algorithms, but also how algorithms are `rendered` in my APP. My early development work was `pioneering` and `from scratch` which is `first` AI APP in the field of college catering. As a leader, I was aware that this research project is customized for our freshmen and maximizes the academic resources our university can provide. When my mission accomplished which accumulated 1,900+ users, 98.12 app score and financial support from Big Name company (Intel and HP). I realized that I had to face the bottleneck of insufficient `academic resources` and limitations of my own `horizon and research capabilities`.<br> 
Therefore, I started working with the **cutting-edge** researchers which begin with serving as a research assistant for Postdoctoral Researcher [*Hongwei Wang*](https://hongweiw.net/). After that, I seek to systematically research which to carry out my **independent research** advised by [*PhD. Xudong Lin*](https://xudonglinthu.github.io/) . Participating in academic conferences, workshops, group meeting, and becoming contributor in Kaggle, etc. have become my daily routine. One of the **most inspiring** experiences in my entire life now has been to be a student of [*prof. Manolis Kellis*]((http://web.mit.edu/manoli/)). my `efficient` research process management capability, `advanced` research milestones mechanism, and `interdisciplinary vision` to meet `all humanity challenge` are benefited from by these experiences. <br>
In the coming period of time, I will mainly `delve` into a field of `long-term research` combined with my interests. I hope that my research system has a good **IUR** (Industry-University-Research) mechanism that can fully develop and expand my potential in three areas.
